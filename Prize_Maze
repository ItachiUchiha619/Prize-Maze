The rules governing the maze
● The maze is provided as a txt file and is also shown above
○ The player is denoted as “P”
○ The prizes are denoted as “£”
○ The maze walls are denoted by “x”
○ The player moves around the maze collecting prizes
○ When a prize is collected it disappears
○ The player starts with health at 150 points
○ It costs 1 health point for a player to move 1 square
○ Each “£” awards 11 health points
The requirements of navigating the maze
● Show how the player “P” can be moved throughout the maze collecting each prize “£”
● Each player move should be shown on the screen by redrawing the maze
● Each time the maze is redrawn, show the current number of health points for the player
1
● Once the player has collected the last prize “£” they must leave the maze
● A player leaves the maze by moving to the exit
● The exit to the maze is where the player “P” started from
● When the player “P” reaches the exit the game is over
● Show the final health points of the player when the game finishes
The requirements of your path-finding algorithm
● You should attempt to derive the most efficient path to collect all prizes “£” and exit
● The health points of the player “P” indicates the efficiency of your path-finding
● The higher the health points, the more efficient your path-finding algorithm is
